## ***What is OpenOctober?*** 

OpenOctober is an opensource based competition organized by **IEEE SFIT**. It is an event dedicated to coding and celebrating the developer in you. <br>

In this event, you can contribute to a live project and make a pull request to the repository you desire to work on. 

### The participant with the maximum number of valid contributions wins.

This competition will go on for a week but don't be disheartened, you can keep contributing after the time is over but it will not be considered for evaluation.


> We believe - and we hope you do too 
>>  that learning how to code, how to think, ¬†and¬†how to contribute to open source¬†can empower the next generation of coders and creators. 
>>> If you are first time contributor,  we want you to know that everyone started from somewhere! 
>>>> So start here!‚ö°
  
## It is a week long coding event on github which implies <b> open source principles at its base.</b></p>
> The event will be held from ***18th to 31st October 2020***</b><br>
